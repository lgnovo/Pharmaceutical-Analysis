# Pharmaceutical-Analysis
An analysis of mock-data for Pymaceuticals, Inc., a pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. The company began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. This project asks to
* Generate summary statistics.
* Create bar charts and pie charts.
* Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot.
* Create a line plot and a scatter plot.
* Calculate correlation and regression.

## Analysis

"Within the Capomulin treatment, mouse weight and average tumor volume appear to have a strong positive correlation of 0.84.

Capomulin and Ramicane were studied for a longer duration of time compared to the 8 other treatments, (Ketapril, Naftisol, Zoniferol, Placebo, Stelasyn, Infubinol, Ceftamin, and Propriva.)

Capomulin and Ramicane appear to have the lowest median tumor values over the course of treatment recorded, at 38.1mm3 and 36.6mm3 respectively, when compared to the end-tumor measurements of Infubinol (60.1mm3) and Ceftamin (59.9mm3.)

Capomulin outperforms Ramicane with increased consistency of results. Capomulin's IQR is tighter than Ramicane by 1.3mm3 despite having a median larger than Ramicane.

Across the boxplots, we continue to see that Capomulin and Ramicane boast low final-tumor volumes compared to Infubinol and Ceftamin. While the span of Ramicane's measurements fall lower than Capomulin's, Capomulin showcases more of a normal distribution with a narrower IQR - more consistency. The IQR of Ramicane is broader and is skewed left, so the bulk of the recordings encompass higher volumes."
